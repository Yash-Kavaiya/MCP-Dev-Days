## Use Case: Zava DIY Retail Company

**Scenario:** Sales Manager at Zava (DIY Retail Company)

**Business Requirements:**
- Analyze sales data to identify trends
- Understand customer preferences
- Make informed business decisions
- Need intelligent data analysis capabilities

**Challenge:** Traditional tools require manual integration and complex workflows

## What is an Agent?

**Definition:**
> Semi-autonomous software that can be given a goal and will work to achieve that goal without you knowing in advance exactly how it's going to do that or what steps it's going to take.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Goal-oriented:** Accepts high-level objectives
- **Autonomous:** Determines its own execution path
- **Adaptive:** Figures out necessary steps independently
- **Intelligent:** Makes decisions without explicit programming for each scenario

## The Evolution and Need for MCP

### Timeline: From Tool Chaos to Standardization

#### Phase 1: Tools are Integral to Agent Capabilities
- Agents require various tools to function effectively
- Each tool provides specific capabilities

#### Phase 2: Integration Chaos
- Multiple disconnected tools and services
- Complex integration requirements
- No standardized communication protocol
- Maintenance overhead and compatibility issues

#### Phase 3: The Need for a Standard (MCP)
- Centralized protocol for tool integration
- Standardized communication between agents and tools
- Simplified architecture and reduced complexity

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Core Concept
**MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs**

### Key Benefits
- **Standardization:** Like USB-C but for AI
- **Business Agility:** Enables rapid development and deployment
- **Interoperability:** Seamless integration between different tools and services
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new capabilities without architectural changes

### Protocol Advantages
- **Open Standard:** Community-driven and vendor-neutral
- **Context Management:** Efficient way to provide relevant information to LLMs
- **Tool Integration:** Simplified connection between agents and external services
- **Developer Experience:** Reduced complexity in building AI agents
