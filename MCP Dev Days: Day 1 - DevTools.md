9:30am PST	MCP Power-User Mode: Revealing Every MCP Feature in VS Code	Think you’ve seen what Model Context Protocol can do inside Visual Studio Code? Think again. In this rapid-fire tour, we’ll flip every switch and surface every hidden gem. Expect zero slides and maximum keyboard: a full-throttle demo that leaves you with the shortcuts, settings, and insider tips to make VS Code the ultimate MCP-powered workbench.	Liam Hampton
10:00am PST	Discoverability Unlocked: Publishing and Finding servers in the MCP Community Registry	Lets take a sneak peak into the open-source MCP community registry. A publish once, consume anywhere project for Model Context Protocol servers being developed by the MCP steering committee. In this 30 minute session we'll talk to the project leaders and unpack how server authors can publish their servers and how different registries and marketplaces can stay up to date with the latest MCP servers.	Toby Padilla, Tadas Antanavicius
10:30am PST	Chat With the Web: Inside NLWeb’s Journey to a Conversational Internet	What if every website could talk back—understanding a visitor’s plain-English question and answering with the exact insight (or next action) they need? In this fireside conversation, Ramanathan Guha— web-standards pioneer (RSS, Schema.org) and the creator of NLWeb—joins core engineers from the project to explain how Microsoft’s new open initiative is turning that vision into reality and how MCP falls into the big picture.	Ramanathan Guha, Jennifer Marsman, Chelsea Carter, James Montemagno
11:00am PST	The Future of User Interaction	We are entering a new era of user interaction. It's being built right before our very eyes and changing rapidly. As crazy as it sounds, soon each one of us will get our own Jarvis capable of performing actually useful tasks for us with a completely different user interaction mechanism than we're used to. But someone's gotta give Jarvis the tools to perform these tasks, and that's where we come in In this talk, Kent will show how this AI assistant user interaction model is shaping out to be, help us catch the vision of what this future could look like, and our role in it.	Kent C. Dodds
11:30am PST	MCP Gets OAuth: Understanding the New Authorization Specification	The Model Context Protocol now fully embraces OAuth 2.1 conventions, bringing mature authorization patterns to AI agent ecosystems. Rather than inventing new auth mechanisms, MCP adopted proven OAuth flows, dynamic client registration, as well as the brand-new Protected Resource Metadata conventions. This session explores how the new spec significantly simplifies the developer experience for both MCP client and server implementers, as well as gives developers more flexibility around integration with existing authorization servers.	Den Delimarsky, Aaron Parecki
12:00pm PST	MCP Workflow: I stopped using SQL for database management	Let's learn how to create and update database schemas using just prompts with GitHub Copilot in VS Code. You will see an example of using GibsonAI MCP together with GitHub MCP Servers to create GitHub pull requests with auto-generated model classes in any programming language.	Bobur Umorzokov
12:30am PST	Boost your productivity with Visual Studio & MCP Servers	Visual Studio now speaks MCP. In this fast-paced session you’ll learn how the IDE’s new Model Context Protocol tooling turns agent-ready APIs into a first-class experience	Allie Barry

This appears to be Anthropic's presentation on MCP, providing their perspective on the protocol's strategic importance and roadmap. Here are the key insights:

## **Historical Context & Strategic Positioning**
Anthropic positions MCP alongside major protocol adoptions in tech history - REST, OAuth, and LSP (Language Server Protocol). The timeline shows MCP as the natural evolution for the AI era, following the same adoption pattern where tech giants embrace standards that solve fundamental integration problems.

## **Deep Microsoft Partnership**
The collaboration goes beyond just Windows integration, with specific joint projects including:
- **OAuth Implementation** - Enterprise authentication standards
- **Registry Co-Leadership** - Shared governance of the community registry  
- **Client Applications** - Cross-platform MCP-enabled apps
- **C# SDK** - Native Windows development support
- **Agent-to-Agent** communication protocols
- **GitHub MCP Server** - Developer workflow integration

## **MCP Roadmap (Current: v0.6.18)**
Anthropic's roadmap shows three key focus areas:

### **Agents** (Current)
- Bidirectional server communication
- Structured tool outputs with JSON schemas
- Resource links and context passing

### **Security** (Next Priority)  
- OAuth 2.1 bearer server support
- Async operations for long-running tasks
- Guides and best practices for developers
- Enterprise managed authorization

### **Protocol Evolution**
- Mandatory version negotiation
- MCP registry for centralized discovery
- Validation tools and streaming support

## **Production Considerations**
Anthropic emphasizes the distinction between:
- **Internal use** - Focus on developer velocity, deployment flexibility
- **External use** - API best practices, security, parameter validation

## **Authoring Patterns Decision Matrix**
The framework helps developers choose the right MCP architecture based on control requirements:
- **1st party control** recommended for prompting
- Challenges vary from "tool sprawl" to "don't control the tool definitions"

## **Developer Engagement**
Three main entry points:
- **Documentation**: `modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro`
- **GitHub**: `github.com/modelcontextprotocol` 
- **Claude Connectors Registry**: `anthropic.com/partners/mcp`

This positions MCP not just as a technical protocol, but as foundational infrastructure for the AI application ecosystem - with Anthropic and Microsoft as key stewards driving enterprise adoption.

This is a detailed technical presentation about the **MCP Community Registry** design, focusing on solving the server discovery problem. Here are the key insights:

## **Registry Leadership**
The project is being co-led by:
- **Tadas Antanavicius** (PulseMCP) - creator of one of the earliest MCP server directories
- **Toby Padilla** (GitHub) - maintainer of the most popular MCP server to-date

## **Core Problems Being Solved**

### **1. Fragmented Discovery**
Third-party registries can't maintain comprehensive server lists due to:
- Nested mono-repos
- Distributed hosting (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Complex web scraping requirements
- Many edge cases

### **2. Metadata Management Burden** 
Server maintainers currently have to manually update descriptions across multiple platforms (GitHub, Smithery, Pulse, etc.)

### **3. Installation Instruction Chaos**
Client apps (VS Code, Goose, Cline) currently rely on "unreliably parsing READMes" for installation instructions, creating a poor developer experience.

## **Architectural Solution**

### **Publisher Workflow**
- Server maintainers use a simple CLI: `mcpr publish ./server.json`
- Single source of truth for server metadata
- Eliminates multi-platform metadata maintenance

### **Consumer Architecture** 
- Central registry at `registry.modelcontextprotocol.to`
- **ETL layer** between official registry and client implementations
- Each client (VS Code, Raycast, Goose) pulls and transforms data as needed

## **Scope Boundaries**
They're being strategic about what they **won't** solve:
- **Source code storage** → Delegated to npm, PyPI, Docker Hub
- **Advanced search/filtering** → Delegated to MCP client marketplaces
- Only basic search by name will be supported initially

## **Schema Development**
Working on four complementary schemas:
- **Base Registry OpenAPI Schema** (reading server data)
- **Base server.json Schema** (publishing server data)  
- **Community Registry schemas** (adding constraints to both)

## **Call for Community Input**
The team is actively seeking:
1. **Documentation review** 
2. **Issue identification** on GitHub
3. **Pull request contributions**

This represents a thoughtful, scoped approach to solving MCP's discovery problem while building sustainable community governance. The emphasis on schemas and ETL layers suggests they're planning for long-term ecosystem growth with multiple client implementations.

This is **Kent Dodds'** (@kentcdodds) presentation on **"The Future of User Interaction"** - a compelling vision of how MCP enables true AI assistants. Here are the key insights:

## **The J.A.R.V.I.S. Vision**
Kent positions MCP as the foundation for creating **"Just A Rather Very Intelligent System"** - referencing Tony Stark's AI assistant that can interact with any system or device seamlessly.

## **The Paradigm Shift**
**Today**: Browsers → Websites  
**Future**: "Jarvis" Clients → MCP Services

This represents a fundamental change from humans navigating web interfaces to AI agents acting on our behalf through standardized protocols.

## **Why Don't We Already Have Jarvis?**
Despite existing AI assistants (Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, etc.), we're missing true general-purpose AI assistants. The answer: **Integrations**.

Current assistants are limited to pre-built integrations, but MCP solves this by enabling connections to virtually any service.

## **The Three-Phase Evolution**

### **Phase 1: Basic LLM**
- Answers questions 🤓
- "Can't do anything" 😞

### **Phase 2: LLM + Tools** 
- Direct tool connections
- Still limited scope

### **Phase 3: LLM + MCP**
- "Can do ANYTHING" 🤩
- Universal service connectivity through standardized protocol

## **MCP Architecture**
The architecture diagram shows the power of MCP:
- **Single Host Application** (with LLM)
- **Multiple MCP Clients** (protocol adapters)
- **Multiple MCP Servers** (service providers)
- **Unlimited Tools** (actual service capabilities)

## **Universal Integration**
The slide showing dozens of company logos (GitHub, Spotify, Netflix, Tesla, Starbucks, etc.) illustrates MCP's potential to connect to any service that implements the protocol.

## **MCP-UI Project**
Kent also highlights **mcpui.dev** - "Interactive UI Components for MCP" - suggesting the ecosystem is building rich, dynamic interfaces for MCP applications, not just command-line tools.

## **Content Resources**
Points to **EpicAI.pro/posts** for extensive MCP content including:
- Game-changing potential of MCP
- User interface evolution
- Tool integration strategies
- Search engine capabilities

This presentation positions MCP as the missing piece that will finally enable the sci-fi vision of AI assistants that can seamlessly interact with our entire digital ecosystem.
